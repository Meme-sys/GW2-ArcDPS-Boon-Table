# ArcDPS Boon Table

![preview](Screenshot.png)

## Usage

Alt+Shift+B (overwrites Arc’s default boon table hotkey) or checkbox in the arc options

Right-click on the header for options menu.  
Right-click on the table to change visible columns.  
Table columns can be reordered by dragging the column header.  
Sort by column by clicking on the header, it is sorted by character name by default.

### options
- Players: Show/Hide all players in the table (Default: ON)
- Subgroups: Show/Hide subgroup average (Default: ON)
- Total: Shoe/Hide groupt/squad average (Default: ON)
- Show value as progress bar: Show the values as progressbar additional to the actual number. (Default: ON)
- Always resize window to content: Will always make the window as big as it has to be to show all boons. This will disable the possibility to resize the window manually. (Default: ON)
- Alternating Row Background: Show/Hide background colors, to better distinguish rows. (Default: ON)
- Coloring Mode: How to color the text/progress bars. Can be Default (Gray), By percentage (red to green), By Profession. (Default: Default)
- Alignment: Align the text to the column. Can be Left, Right, Center and Unaligned. Unaligned means, that it is most left as possible, without beeing on top of the progress bar. (Default: Right)
